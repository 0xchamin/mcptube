                <p>Lewis Hamilton faces a pivotal year at Ferrari in 2026. At 41 years old, after a difficult first season with the team, the seven-time world champion is at a critical juncture in his storied Formula 1 career. This report analyzes the challenges ahead and the factors that could determine whether Hamilton can turn things around and make his Ferrari chapter a success.</p>

                <h2>The Situation: A Difficult First Year</h2>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Key Challenge:</strong> Hamilton's first season at Ferrari didn't meet expectations. The team struggled to "gel" together, and the relationship dynamics proved challenging.

                <h3>The Age Factor</h3>
                <p>At 41, Hamilton is closer to the end of his career than the beginning. This makes 2026 potentially one of his last few years in Formula 1, adding urgency to the situation. The question remains: can one of the greatest drivers of all time deliver at Ferrari before it's too late?</p>
